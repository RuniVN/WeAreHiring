# Team Activities

We know that 'Life is not just about work', we usually spend time together to go around and enjoy the Work-Life balance.

### Board games and card games

We are fan of board games and card games. We organise meetup every weekend for our team members, friends and other startups to keep the balance between work and life, also expand our connections to the world.

Currently we are falling for those games

### Trip

We spend 3 to 5 days per quarter to travel around the country to refresh and boost up our productivity. We believe it is better than just stay in the room.
